# Auth0 + Go Web App Sample

This sample demonstrates how to add authentication to a Go web app using Auth0.

Check the [Go Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/golang) to better understand this sample.

## Running the App

To run the app, make sure you have **go** installed.

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and provide your Auth0 credentials.

```bash
# .env

AUTH0_CLIENT_ID={CLIENT_ID}
AUTH0_DOMAIN={DOMAIN}
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET={CLIENT_SECRET}
AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/callback
```

Once you've set your Auth0 credentials in the `.env` file, run `go build ./...` to build and install the Go dependencies.

Run `go run main.go server.go` to start the app and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
